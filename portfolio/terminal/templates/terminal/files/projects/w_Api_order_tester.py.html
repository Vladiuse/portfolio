<p>Its a python modul that can create orders, without using user interface. One of my job procces, i need to test, is orders from site send correctly. For it you must do a lot of job by hands:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to site</li>
    <li>Find needed product</li>
    <li>Create streem</li>
    <li>Add some information in streem settings</li>
    <li>Find in table phones numbers for current countrys</li>
    <li>Send orders</li>
    <li>go to tracker and find orders to see there status</li>
</ul>
<p>My app just need to set product ID and chose countrys that you need to send orders.</p>
<p>All other work app will do it for you.</p>
